        <h2>Problem Description</h2>

        <p>In my project, I am looking into problems about waiting in line in restaurants. In Seattle, there are a lot of famous restaurants.
            And the most problem people may encounter is that they need to wait for hours and hours to get into the restaurant. But they did not have a plan for that.
            The waiting list information in a lot of the restaurants are on an old-school paper, not digital.
            In some places, you would have a fancier app which helps to get in line and send you a text message. However, they do not share the data with the customer.
            Those app companies are restaurant-centric not customer-centric
            Customers would love to see the waiting list of each restaurant and would make their choice based on that as well.

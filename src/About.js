When they open up this web app, they are able to see the restaurant around itself. The restaurant data would come from Yelp API and Google Map API for mapping.Customers are able to view the Yelp comments and photos on the map and able to see its own waiting information.

For those which do not have waiting information, customers can submit a wait estimate time to earn some points, which can be exchanged the coupon for some restaurants.

After they enjoyed the meal, they can rate the restaurant with starts. In the backend of the system, we can have a machine learning model running for each customer, and making their own profile to give our recommendation in restaurants.

This Web App could effectively show people estimate waiting time, which could be a very important factor to help people to decide where to eat.</p>
